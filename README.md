Conference Badge Generator

A React-based web application allowing conference attendees to overlay their headshot onto an official event frame.

How It Works

The app loads template.png from the root directory.

It detects the specific green background color (chroma key) in the template and makes it transparent.

Users upload their own photo.

Users position/scale their photo behind the template frame.

The final composite image is downloadable as a PNG.

Setup

Upload index.html to this repository.

Upload the conference frame image to this repository and rename it to template.png.

Enable GitHub Pages in Settings > Pages.
